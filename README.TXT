TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

This project is discussed in chapter 6.

This project aims to implements a technical support system for customers of 
the DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

This project is only a first, rudimentary step towards the full solution.

24. Hashmaps are a combination of arraylists and variables, but they also allow you to strore values.
25. parameters can be similar but keys cannot be similar since it can cause errors and complications (with overwritting).
26. size() method.
28. Overwrites previous value.
29. Error.
30. phoneBook.containsKey()
31. null
32. loop & KeySet()
34. Collection and in addition duplicated aren't allowed in hash sets (which is critical about them)
